#Overview:
A simple web scraping project where I scraped data from the TFT stats site 'tactics.tools', and made a quick summary of the data scraped from the site. 
The site has a variety of data on unit performance, popularity, as well as data on every player's match history. Shown here are the files used for the web scraping project (Using Scrapy) as well as a Jupyter Notebook summarizing the results.
